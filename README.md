This repository contains some simulations recomended during the Statistical Mechanics'course coducted during 2021-2022 at University of Milan, physics department.

1. The first simulation is was proposed in order to study Random Walks and Self-Avoiding Random Walks in different dimensions. I implemented Pivot's Algorithm due to generate Self-Avoiding paths.
2. In the second exercise I simulated a bidimensional Ising Model with a Metropolis implementation, and with SweepWolff algorithm. A cluster size function is defined at the end of the simulation.
3. At least, I simulated an epidemic with SIR model. Firstly, I supposed a fully mixed population, than I repeated the dynamic on a defined Graph (Small-world-newtork) and compared this two models. At the end I've repeated the simulations that can be found in "The spread of epidemic disease on networks-M. E. J. Newman" paper confirming their results.
